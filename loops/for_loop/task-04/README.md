Write a for (note: not a function) loop that prints out the factorial of the number 12:

(A factorial is calculated by multiplying a number by all the numbers below it. For instance, 3! or "3 factorial" is 3 \ *2 * 1 = 6)

3! = 321 = 6
4! = 432∗1 = 24
4! = 432∗1 = 24
5! = 54321 = 120
5! = 54321 = 120

Save your final answer in a variable called solution and print it to the console.
